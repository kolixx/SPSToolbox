function [inconf, Z] = IsModelPartOfSPSConfidenceSet(model, sps, Y, U, performanceMeasure)
%
%  Gets if a given model is part of the sps confidence set or not.
%
%  Input arguments:
%     - the model that describes the system structure
%     - sps: the sps setup
%     - Y, U: column vectors of the same size containing the output and the
%     input respectively
%     - performanceMeasure: a function handle to evaluate DP peformance
%
%
%  Output arguments:
%     - inconf: boolean indicator of the membership to the confidence set
%     - Z: the different Z values that were used to determine the
%     membership
