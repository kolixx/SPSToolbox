%
% This script is an example that illustrates the correct behaviour of the
% SPS hypothesis test
%
%
% Confidence set membership query is perfomed for a large number of
% realizations. For a confidece set of confidence 95%, the membership of
% the nominal model should be true for 95% of the trials. Different
% condidence levels are checked.
%
% The fist part of the script is time consuming, it calculates a lot of
% indicator values. See more detailed description inside the script.
%
%  The second part visualizes the results.
